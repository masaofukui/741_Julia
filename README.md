# EC 741 Julia Codes (Boston University)

This repository has Julia codes for the second part of EC741, a part of the second-year macro sequence at Boston University, as taught in fall 2024.

The course covers heterogeneous firm models with a particular focus on the determinants of aggregate labor demand. Most of the codes are written in continuous time.
* Topic 1: Firm size distribution (Gabaix, 1999).
  * [KFE.jl](https://github.com/masaofukui/741_Julia/blob/main/Topic1/KFE.jl): Code to solve Kolmogorov Forward Equation to solve for the firm size distirbution in the steady state and in the transition.
* Topic 2: Canonical model of firm dynamics (Hopenhayn and Rogerson, 1993)
* Topic 3: Declining Business Dynamism and Transition Dynamics with Free-entry (Karahan, Şahin, and Pugsley, 2024)
* Topic 4: Transition Dynamics without Free-entry (Auclert, Bardóczy, Rognlie, and Straub, 2021)
* Topic 5: Firm Dynamics with Labor Adjustment Costs (Hopenhayn and Rogerson, 1993)
* Topic 6: Firm Dynamics in a Frictional Labor Market (McCrary, 2024)
